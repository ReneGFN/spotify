#Imersao-front-end-alura
This project is a Spotify clone built during Alura's Imers√£o Front-End 2. It features a responsive interface that allows users to search for artists and explore music. The application dynamically loads data from a JSON server, displaying artist information such as their names, genres, and images, and provides clickable play buttons to simulate user interaction. The data includes a list of artists, each with their own Spotify URL, allowing users to access their official Spotify page directly.
